# 🎤 Introducing **VoiceScript**: Voice Chat Meets Lua + AI

Have you ever wanted to take your **SimpleVoiceChat** or **PlasmoVoice** experience to the next level?

Well, here it is — I’m excited to introduce **VoiceScript**, a powerful plugin that opens up a whole new way to interact with voice chat on your Minecraft server.

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** VoiceScript is **still in development**, but here's a sneak peek at what's coming!

## 🚀 What is VoiceScript?

VoiceScript is a voice-powered scripting platform that brings the power of **Lua** scripting and **VOSK AI** speech recognition into your server. It's designed for advanced server developers and creative scripters who want to make voice a first-class part of gameplay.

## 🔧 Key Features

1. 📜 **Lightweight Lua scripting support** (via LuaJ)
   - Write minimal scripts to define actions
2. 🧠 **Speech recognition with VOSK AI**
   - Converts player voice into text in real time
3. 🎮 **Trigger in-game actions from voice commands**
   - React to what players *say*, not just what they *type*

## 🔄 How It Works

Players speak ➡️ VOSK recognizes speech ➡️ Your Lua script reacts accordingly

## 🚫 Development Status

VoiceScript is **actively in development**. Features are being tested, refined, and expanded — so stay tuned for future updates, previews, and beta releases.

---

Whether you're looking to build, voice-controlled events, or just want to play around with speech-driven gameplay, **VoiceScript** is your new sandbox.

**Coming soon to a server near you.**
